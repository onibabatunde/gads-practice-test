#Lab: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

#Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

	-Initialize App Engine.

	-Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

	-Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

	-Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

#Steps: 
1. Initialize App Engine.

	Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region as us-central1:

		gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECTID --region=us-central1

	Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

		git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

	Navigate to the source directory:

		cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

	Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.

		sudo apt-get update

	Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system

		sudo apt-get install virtualenv

	You should get a result similar to this: 

	virtualenv -p python3 venv

	Activate the virtual environment.

		source venv/bin/activate

	Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

		pip install  -r requirements.txt

	Run the application:

		python main.py

	Abort the deployed service to stop the test run

		gcloud app versions stop python main.py

3. Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

	Navigate to the source directory:

		cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

	Deploy your Hello World application.

		gcloud app deploy

3. Disable the App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible

	Disable the appengine application by running this command:

		gcloud app stop
